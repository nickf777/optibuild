# optibuild
Redesign of Optibuild.ca

To Do:

- Priority Nuber One is to make it responsive now with media queries

    - Wrappers



- Need pictures of the owners to personalize the page
- Need to find a way to collect client testimonials using a form (email?)
- Need to get new, better testimonials 


- Have a call to action to get a free quote on every page


- Organize the gallery based on specific services offered and then have the index.html pages take you to that specific part of the gallery page

- Services page is a little boring, look for ways to make it more interesting
    - Pop-up window with explanations instead of scroll
    - More interesting layout
    - More interesting stylings


- Needs a favicon on each page
-Forms need to actually do something
- Create a contact form that sends users to a contact page rather than to their email
