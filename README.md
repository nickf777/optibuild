# optibuild
Redesign of Optibuild.ca

To Do:

- Priority Number One is to make it responsive now with media queries
    - To add to other weebpages
        - Transfer wrapper rule, unique flex-container rules, media queries, make new JS file and transfer hamburger functionality, hamburger html, add wrappers to relevant sections, add margin 0 auto to sections you don't have a wrapper on(?)
    - Add Hamburger menu to other webpages
    - Otherwise it seems to be minor formatting things that might be fixed with min-widths and percentages and might not require media queries at all
    -

    - Wrappers: added the rule-set but will break positioning on all divs
        - Need to add wrappers and fix divs individually
        - Next time, this needs to be a part of your early workflow 



- Need pictures of the owners to personalize the page
- Need to find a way to collect client testimonials using a form (email?)
- Need to get new, better testimonials 


- Have a call to action to get a free quote on every page


- Organize the gallery based on specific services offered and then have the index.html pages take you to that specific part of the gallery page

- Services page is a little boring, look for ways to make it more interesting
    - Pop-up window with explanations instead of scroll
    - More interesting layout
    - More interesting stylings


- Needs a favicon on each page
-Forms need to actually do something
- Create a contact form that sends users to a contact page rather than to their email
